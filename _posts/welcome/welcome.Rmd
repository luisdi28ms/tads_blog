## Welcome to my blog

My name is Luis Diego Monge, I am one semester away from completing my bachelor's
degree in statistics. I've decided to start this blog to document my progress on
sharpening my data analysis and visualization skills, hopefully you can find this
as a valuable resource for learning data analysis in R and maybe Python in the
near future. I'll do my best to include useful resources and generate clear
and understandable code for you.
